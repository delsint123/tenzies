Scrimba React Course Project 4

The instructions of the game: Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls.

This game was created as the final project in the Scrimba: Learn React course. The project uses HTML, CSS, JS, but predominantly React. This is meant to incorporated all the fundamental concepts that were taught in this course which includes React hooks useEffect and useState, components, props, JSX, and basic React syntax. It also utilized some node packages such as nanoid and react-confetti.
